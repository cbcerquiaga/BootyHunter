Here is where we can put down ideas. Feel free to change whatever you want, or add anything.

Basic Enemies
Maybe we can assign a "difficulty value" to each enemy type, and each wave is allowed to have a higher difficulty value.
1. Gunboat- small, slow, and shitty. Only shoots one shot. Difficulty value of 1
2. Ship- exactly like the player's ship. Difficulty value of 4?
3. Dhow- faster than the player's ship, but less heavily armored (3 hits?). Fires a single cannon from the bow. Has a long, skinny profile and a single sail that only has left and right tack sprites.
  Difficulty value of 9?
4. Man O’ War- slower than the player's ship, but more heavily armored (12 hits?). Has 2 sails that look like the regular player’s ship, and 6 cannons on each side.
  The sprite is 32 pixels wide. Difficulty value of 9?

Bosses
If we even do bosses. I really want to, and I think it'll make the game be actually good, but it's a stretch goal for now.
Potentially, we could break up bosses into two groups- "easy" and "hard", and have a higher chance of a "hard" boss the higher the wave is.
1. Kraken- head takes damage, tentacles seek out the player and don't take damage.
    The head disappears briefly after being hit and reappears somewhere else.
2. Mother Of All Boats- giant ship that doesn't really move, has cannons that shoot in bullet-hell patterns.
3. Megaladon- giant super shark that seeks the player
4. Chinese Junk- ship that fires exploding rockets (with proximity fuses) instead of cannonballs
5. Hurricane- can't actually be killed by the player, just lives for a certain amount of time and then disappears
6. Moby Dick- moves around the map in pre-designed patterns, regardless of what the player does
7. Spanish Galleon- runs away from the player, dropping bombs
8. Viking longboat- like a normal ship, but it goes at top speed in all directions, regardless of wind, and takes a ton of damage
9. Ironclad- moves in predesigned patterns and fires in 4 directions
10. Ghost ship- mirror's all of the player's actions, can't run into islands or whitecaps.
11. Loch Ness Monster- doesn't attack the player, rarely ever spawns so players think it's a myth
12.

Power-ups
1. Treasure- the player's score is how much treasure they pick up, not how many kills they get. Treasure is dropped by killed enemies.
    We may want it to disappear after a certain amount of time, or slide down wind and disappear off the edge of the map. We also may
    want treasure to sometimes randomly blow in with enemies
2. Health- restores 1 health
3. Full health- returns the ship to max health (6)
4. Accurate shot- makes bullets fly straight instead of spraying for a short period of
5. Invincibility- turns the ocean red and makes any ramming attack instantly fatal for the enemy.
6. Boarding pirate- once the ship is close to an enemy, a pirate jumps off of the player's ship onto the enemy,
   instantly killing it (not sure what to do with bosses) and automatically collecting the treasure it drops

UI
1. Treasure map- It would be sweet if we made the web page have a tan frame around the game, and make it look like a treasure map.
  Ideally, we could even keep information there (like score, wave, wind) so it doesn't clutter the screen and the game
2. Sea Color- Instead of having a health bar, we could have the color of the sea change as the player's health goes down. It could
  go from the current friendly blue-green, to a deep navy, to an ugly gray. Depending on how we want to implement health, it could
  be a sliding, gradual scale, or it could be a simple three hits, three colors system.
3. Upon the player's death, it would be funny to have a randomly selected, historically accurate pirate fact appear on screen along with
   the player's final score, total number of enemies killed, and list of each boss killed
4.

Other
1. Players should get more points for picking up treasure at higher speed. This would encourage players to
   play faster, and make the game more difficult.
